# Background
Manganese (Mn) is a trace element critical to key physiological processes as a cofactor. Mn homeostasis is controlled mainly by three recently identified transporters;
the influx transporters slc39a10 and slc39a8 and the efflux transporter slc30a10. Using a zebrafish model of a loss-of-function (LOF) slc39a14, I identified
		* 1. Differentially expressed genes upon Mn exposure
  		* 2. Putative gene ontology terms and kegg pathways affected by Mn overload. 

# Method
slc39a14^-/- and slc39a14^+/+ zebrafish were exposed to 20 ÂµM of MnCl~2
